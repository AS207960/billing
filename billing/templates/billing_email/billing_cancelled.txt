Hello {{ name }},

The subscription payment of Â£{{ value|floatformat:2 }}, for {{ plan_name }} has failed.
This was the last attempt.

{% include "billing_email/item_card.txt" with item=item %}

{% if charge_state.last_error %}Last error: {{ charge_state.last_error }}
{% endif %}The subscription has been cancelled, and the resources associated with it will placed on hold/deleted.

Thanks,
