Hello {{ name }},

The subscription payment of Â£{{ item.amount|abs|floatformat:2 }}, for {{ plan_name }} has failed.

{% include "billing_email/item_card.txt" with item=item %}

{% if charge_state.last_error %}Last error: {{ charge_state.last_error }}
{% endif %}We'll retry the payment, however if it consistently fails the subscription will be cancelled,
and the resources associated with it placed on hold/deleted.

Thanks,
